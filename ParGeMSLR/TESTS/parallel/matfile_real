Line 1:  Number of general matrices
Line 2:  Starting from this line, the path of the matrix files
         After that, the path of the vector files.
         -Begin with 0: use one vector as solution.
         -Begin with nonzero: load the vector file
         Repeat, until enouth matrices are listed
