Line 1:  Number of general matrices
Line 2:  Starting from this line, the path of the matrix files
         After that, the path of the vector files.
         -"0 ." use one vector as solution. NOTE: use "0 ." instead of "0".
         -"1 path" load the vector file
         Repeat, until enouth matrices are listed
